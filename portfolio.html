          <p>High-rise window washer is an autonomous cleaning drone. It was designed for building manager and town house households. It can help people to wash the high-rise windows quickly and easily, because it requires for only an app to operate. Users can set the cleaning time, location and mode through the app on your mobile phone. You can put your phone aside and focus on the work you are busy now, waiting for the drone to be automatically cleaned and recycled. During this time, the building includes every glass will be showed on a mobile phone using a 3D model, and you can check the cleanliness of the building from your mobile phone at any time. And a simple-structure building usually takes about ten minutes to clean up. The using process is absolutely safe and can reduce the unnecessary casualties of those high-rise window washers. However, please don’t worry about this will make those high-rise window washers lose their jobs, because you can also hire a professional cleaner to help you manually clean the complex buildings with this cleaning drone by the app.</p>

          <p>Our group has a meeting to discuss the two concepts firstly, basic and pro. Basic is for building manager and the pro is for professional washers. And we make a list about the advantages of these two concepts. After that, we started to draw the interface of app on paper. When it is finished, each group member has to evaluate the two concept to give some suggestions, and write some notes on the paper. Then the person who drew this concept need to draw more interfaces and modify the sketches to make it more comfort for users. After that, we repeat the previous iterative process to make sure there are no bugs. Because next step is let users to test the mobile prototype. We cut it from the paper and give users to survey for the development of this application. And they gave us some advice, such as ‘Don’t have a page of connecting’ , ‘The differences of basic and pro are not clearly’ ‘Too complex and difficult to understand if there are no annotates’ and ‘How to make sure about the drone won’t fall to the ground and make somebody hurts?’ to improve the user experiences. After that, we mixed the two concepts because we found that both concepts have a certain amount of market demand. By arranging feedback from the evaluation, most of the participants believe that the two concepts can be combined and improved, so that the user can could adopt the application into their business and lifestyle. Anyway, we did a testing again after the combination. Actually, they think the interfaces are great, and they are satisfied with our help page specially. Compared to the history interface, they believed that this feature can help them effectively solve the problems encountered in use.</p>
          <p>During working on the part of final wireframes, we choose our main color of the interface is blue, green and white. Because retina's three types of cones are preferentially sensitive to blue, green, and red. additionally, we did some changes to make it more good-looking. In homepage, we changed the size of ‘START’ button, to make it to be more different from the other three buttons. It can make people know that they should touch this button to get started use the window washer machines. Additionally, we moved the remind image to the top, which is a notification now. Moreover, for users can see the whole processing of cleaning, we add a 3d model to instead of the building. The green windows means cleaning over, and the grey ones mean that have not been cleaned yet. Due to the feedback of the users, we modified the summary section to make it more good-looking.</p>

          <p>In the whole flow, I think our team did a good job. However, we could do more iterations at the evaluation section. Anyway, during the working project, our team members worked very well. Each member could use their ability to work. And the workload are equally. Hope we could work together in the next semester! </p>
